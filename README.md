A library for live visuals performance with Processing sketches

This was a very good idea back when software like TouchDesigner, Notch, and Unreal Engine, did not exist - but now it is no longer worth maintaining.

I've left it up as an interesting historical artefact, and as a simple demonstration of the "Puppeteering" concept: media software which lacks a GUI, can gain one by implementing OpenSoundControl / OSCQuery, over which software such as [TWO](https://thewizardofosc.com) can then control them.

If you download TWO, the AudioVisualBach example program, contains mother.

Mother is only compatible with Processing 2, and will not work with newer versions.
