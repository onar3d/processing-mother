/**
* Mother Main Sketch
* by Ilias Bergstrom
* 
* Run this sketch to run Mother. You will not need to customize this sketch,
* it is only provided as an easy way to start Mother.
* 
* If you are unfamiliar with Mother, to get a basic idea, run this sketch and then the MotherControllerExample, 
* and then use the contols in the second to add synths and manipulate their parameters.
* For more info, read the included "Mother Documentation.pdf" file.
* 
* All settings are made in the Mother.ini file, which resides in the data folder of this
* MotherDelivery.pde.
* 
* If you get a crash, chances are that it is one of your Visual synths / sketches
* that have malfunctioned, or that you have run out of memory. Check the console for 
* hopefully informative error messages.
*
* Note that Mother depends on you having installed the oscP5 library in your library folder!
*
* To test out your sketches while developing, you just run this sketch so that you can view output alongside the console.
* For running in fullscreen, export this MotherDelivery sketch ("Export Application") with the fullscreen option selected. 
* resolution is still set in the mother.ini file.
*
*
* If things do not work and you get error messages in the console, ckech that:
*
* you have implemented the "void initializeFoetus()" method, and followed all the other instructions 
* in the "Mother Documentation" PDF file.
*
* Mother can find your synth(s)
* 
* you correctly include all the libraries that your synth uses 
* in the folder specified for this purpose, as per the above PDF document.

* Overriding this is not really supposed to be done in normal Processing sketches,
