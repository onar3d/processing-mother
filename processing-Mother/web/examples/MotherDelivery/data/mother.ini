# This is where Mother looks for the synth jar files.
# The default is the data/Synths folder residing in the same folder as the sketch that loads the Mother library.
# The MotherDelivery example already comes with the necessary folder structure, and all you need is add to it.
# You can alternatively point to a different folder in your filesystem in which case you need to set
# 'UseCustomSynthFolder=1', and 'SynthFolder' to point to your chosen folder.
# The folder you point to needs to also include two subfolders, "data" and "libraries".
# So if you are on Windows and keep your synths in "X:\\Synths", you also need to create folders
# "X:\\Synths\\data", and "X:\\Synths\\libraries".
# Analogously, on mac these three folders would be:
# "/Users/Mother/Synths", "/Users/Mother/Synths/data" 
# and "/Users/Mother/Synths/libraries" respectively.
